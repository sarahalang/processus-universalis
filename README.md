# *Processus Universalis* annotated XML corpus
This repository contains XML documents from the 2018-2019 "Processus Universalis" project by Netzwerk Alchemie (Gotha) and serves as a testbed to explore future applications building on this chemically annotated recipe corpus data.

## The project
Certain procedures in historical recipe groups, particularly those of significant interest, became the focus of extensive reworking and circulation. One such cluster of texts is the *Processus Universalis*, which exists in over 100 known manuscript versions (Gelius 1996, Moenius et al. 2023).
Since 2018, the [Gotha Alchemy Network](https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/gotha-research-centre/research/working-groups-and-networks/alchemy-network) has undertaken a comprehensive study of this group. Historians of chemistry involved in the project have transcribed 17 versions of the *Processus Universalis* and catalogued many more (Moenius et al. 2023). These texts have been systematically analysed from historical, archival, and chemical perspectives. A substantial number of recipes were also reproduced in laboratory conditions to assess their chemical plausibility, functionality, and points of failure. This collaborative endeavour culminated in a large edited volume that brings together the findings of this scholarly and experimental effort.

By 2019, the project had begun to explore computational approaches to textual analysis, including the use of stylometry to group similar recipe variants (within the *Processus Universalis* group, forthcoming edited collection). These early experiments succeeded in replicating groupings previously established through chemical and historical scholarship (Werthmann/Wunderlich 2023). While such findings may appear to merely confirm existing knowledge, it remains striking how a computational tool that only had access to language data was able to reproduce conclusions that historians had reached relying mainly on their chemical knowledge. 
However, these digital experiments (such as using R Stylo, Eder/Rybicki/Kestemont 2016) were initially constrained by the linguistic nature of the source material. The texts are primarily written in Early Modern German, often interspersed with Latin, and lacked standardised orthography. Consequently, most natural language processing tools available at the time performed poorly. Text reuse analysis, using tools such as [Jonathan Reeve’s text matcher](github.com/JonathanReeve/text-matcher), did yield some results and remains a valuable resource in the digital humanities due to its compatibility with historical language variants. Nonetheless, the visualisation and interpretation of text reuse proved challenging: The extent of textual overlap among the *Processus Universalis* manuscripts is such that traditional linear comparison methods are insufficient; network-based representations are more appropriate, though they complicate textual comparison.

Dating the texts also presents a difficulty: while a few manuscripts are datable, the majority are not, limiting chronological analysis. Despite these constraints, the project has yielded a valuable corpus for future research. In addition to the 17 fully transcribed texts, an XML dataset exists in which scholars have manually annotated and categorised key structural components of the recipes. These annotations identify various steps in the chemical processes, noting which authors reference which components and which omit them. This structured data in key–value format is also available, but it was not yet utilised in earlier stages of the project. 
The combination of chemically validated data (Werthmann/Wunderlich 2023), manual expert-verified textual annotation, and more advanced digital tools suggests a new phase of scholarship may be possible, one that integrates computational analysis to uncover patterns and insights not accessible through traditional methods alone.

## The data
As explained above, the *Processus Universalis* recipe group appears in over fifty texts, seventeen of which have been fully transcribed and annotated by human experts with information about the chemical processes and procedural stages described and extensively studied (experimentally, digitally and traditionally), resulting in the availability of ample contextual information. In particular, this can be found in the detailed studies (articles) in which scholars of the Gotha Alchemy Network document how they interpreted the historical texts, derived experimental hypotheses, and validated these through laboratory replication. This provides a uniquely detailed ground truth for tracing the complete interpretative process from text to experiment and verified chemical result. Since then, computational methods have advanced considerably, allowing us to build directly on this well-prepared dataset, a goldmine yet untapped.

The XML data include both full transcriptions and key-value annotations standardised across the corpus, providing a human-generated ground truth (graciously provided by Alexander Kraft and Thomas Moenius) to train and evaluate any algorithms.

Such validated data are essential for replicating this interpretative process computationally to extract the underlying chemistry from alchemical language. Given the complexity of this task, having human-verified results for this recipe group will be of exceptional value, serving as a sandbox and testbed for developing and evaluating AI methods to extract the underlying chemistry from alchemical language.
